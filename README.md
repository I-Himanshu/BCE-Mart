# Functionality & Concepts used
I have used `Material Theme` for a great UI and used ```Scaffold``` for a good structure.  

Used ```Image```, ```painterResource```, ```Text```, ```Icon``` for designing card of products.

This consist of several scrollable multipages sections, where different Functionality is divided in such a great manner which boost its UX. Every product has a button with heart icon that may be used to add items in Favourite section

Profile section is also very user friendly, And there is a drawer which open and close with smooth animation
